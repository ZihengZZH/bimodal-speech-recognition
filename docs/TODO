    ☐ solve the dimensionality problem
    This problem arises perhaps because each mfcc file (containing entire information about one person speaking one letter, which of course, last for more than one frame) might contain 4 frames according to the visualization of the lips. Therefore, (2n-1) * (2*13) could be mfcc for 4 frames. Solve tommorrow
    ✔ get spectrogram feature for audio @done(19-04-08 17:55)
    ☐ build the pipeline
        ☐ build the RBM
        ☐ build the AE for single modality
    ☐ upload preprocessed data
